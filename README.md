# comparisons

The intent is to compare popular independent component analysis (ICA) methods to the results from Dypac (https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/dypac) for the same databases when similar or comparable preprocessing methods are used. Data consists of publicly available databases with various subject ages and conditions, including: SIMON, ABIDE, ADHD-200, CCNA, and UKBB. Preprocessing for all datasets were completed using NIAK's fMRI preprocessing pipeline (https://niak.simexp-lab.org/build/html/PREPROCESSING.html). Resampled, minimally preprocessed data was used with accompanying confounds. The R2 mappings will also be compared with more traditional ICA and Nilearn Dictionary Learning.
