# comparisons

The intent is to compare popular independent component analysis (ICA) methods to the results from Dypac (https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/dypac) for the same databases when similar or comparable preprocessing methods are used. Data consists of publicly available databases with various subject ages and conditions, including: SIMON, ABIDE, ADHD-200, ADNI, OASIS, and UKBB. Preprocessing for all datasets were completed using NIAK's fMRI preprocessing pipeline (https://niak.simexp-lab.org/build/html/PREPROCESSING.html). Analysis methods for comparison will consist of: Dypac, FSL Melodic ICA, GIFT, and Nilearn ICA and Dictionary Learning.
